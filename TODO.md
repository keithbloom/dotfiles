## To automate

- Bash config (profile, rc, prompt)
- i3 config
- X config
	- Even better to have some control over running on my laptop or connected to external screens
- git (aliases)

## Process (all based on https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles)

- Make file to automate the process
- Do everything else
